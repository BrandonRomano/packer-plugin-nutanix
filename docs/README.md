The `Nutanix` multi-component plugin can be used with HashiCorp [Packer](https://www.packer.io)
to create custom images.

### Installation

To install this plugin, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration, then run [`packer init`](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/init).

```
packer {
  required_plugins {
    nutanix = {
      version = ">= 0.8.0"
      source  = "github.com/nutanix-cloud-native/nutanix"
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use `packer plugins install` to manage installation of this plugin.

```sh
$ packer plugins install github.com/nutanix-cloud-native/nutanix
```

### Components

#### Builders

- [gridscale](/packer/integrations/gridscale/latest/components/builder/gridscale) - The builder takes a template (in gridscale) or an iso-image, runs any provisioning necessary on the template/iso-image after launching it, then snapshots it into a reusable template. This reusable template can then be used as the foundation of new servers that are provisioned within gridscale user space.

### Limitations
#### Building temporary ISOs on MacOS
If you want to use the cd_files Option to create an additional iso-image for kickstart-files or similar be aware that MacOS wonÂ´t create a suitable file.
Please install xorriso for support on MacOS.
```
 brew install xorriso
```
